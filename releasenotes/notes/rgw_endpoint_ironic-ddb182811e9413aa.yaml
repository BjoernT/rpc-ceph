upgrade:
  - Adjust the defaults for Rados Gateway and Keystone
    integration. The RGW endpoint URLs now include the
    tenant_id, and the Rados Gateway settings include the
    ``rgw_swift_account_in_url`` and
    ``rgw_keystone_implicit_tenants`` options which are
    now both set to ``true`` when integrating with
    OpenStack and Keystone.
